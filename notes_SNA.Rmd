using igraph

create netowrk


```{r}
#undirected
g1 <- graph( edges=c(1,2, 2,3, 3, 1), n=3, directed=F ) 

plot(g1)
class(g1)
g1
```


```{r}
# Now with 10 vertices, and directed by default:

g2 <- graph( edges=c(1,2, 2,3, 3, 1), n=10 )

plot(g2)   
```


```{r}
g3 <- graph( c("John", "Jim", "Jim", "Jill", "Jill", "John")) # named vertices
```

```{r}
g4 <- graph( c("John", "Jim", "Jim", "Jack", "Jim", "Jack", "John", "John"), 

             isolates=c("Jesse", "Janis", "Jennifer", "Justin") )  

# In named graphs we can specify isolates by providing a list of their names.



plot(g4, edge.arrow.size=.5, vertex.color="gold", vertex.size=15, 

     vertex.frame.color="gray", vertex.label.color="black", 

     vertex.label.cex=0.8, vertex.label.dist=2, edge.curved=0.2) 
```


Small graphs can also be generated with a description of this kind: - for undirected tie, +- or -+ for directed ties pointing left & right, ++ for a symmetric tie, and “:” for sets of vertices.


```{r}
plot(graph_from_literal(a---b, b---c)) # the number of dashes doesn't matter
plot(graph_from_literal(a--+b, b+--c))
plot(graph_from_literal(a+-+b, b+-+c)) 
plot(graph_from_literal(a:b:c---c:d:e))
g1 <- graph_from_literal(a-b-c-d-e-f, a-g-h-b, h-e:f:i, j)
plot(g1)
```



# 2.2 Edge, vertex, and network attributes


```{r}
g4
plot(g4)
E(g4) # The edges of the object
V(g4) # vertices
```

You can also examine the network matrix directly:

```{r}
g4[]
g4[1,] 
```

*Add attributes to the network, vertices, or edges*

```{r}
V(g4)$name # automatically generated when we created the network.
```

```{r}
V(g4)$gender <- c("male", "male", "male", "male", "female", "female", "male") #vet attibute?

E(g4)$type <- "email" # Edge attribute, assign "email" to all edges

E(g4)$weight <- 10    # Edge weight, setting all existing edges to 10
```

examine attirbutes

```{r}
edge_attr(g4)
vertex_attr(g4)
```

```{r}
graph_attr(g4)
```


Another way to set attributes (you can similarly use set_edge_attr(), set_vertex_attr(), etc.):


```{r}
g4 <- set_graph_attr(g4, "name", "Email Network")
g4 <- set_graph_attr(g4, "something", "A thing")

graph_attr_names(g4)
graph_attr(g4, "name")
g4 <- delete_graph_attr(g4, "something")

graph_attr(g4)
```

print the object to see what is happening above!

```{r}
plot(g4, edge.arrow.size=.5, vertex.label.color="black", vertex.label.dist=1.5,

     vertex.color=c( "pink", "skyblue")[1+(V(g4)$gender=="male")] ) 
```

The graph g4 has two edges going from Jim to Jack, and a loop from John to himself. We can simplify our graph to remove loops & multiple edges between the same nodes. Use edge.attr.comb to indicate how edge attributes are to be combined - possible options include sum, mean, prod (product), min, max, first/last (selects the first/last edge’s attribute). Option “ignore” says the attribute should be disregarded and dropped.


```{r}
g4s <- simplify( g4, remove.multiple = T, remove.loops = F, 

                 edge.attr.comb=c(weight="sum", type="ignore") )

plot(g4s, vertex.label.dist=1.5)
g4s
```

The description of an igraph object starts with up to four letters:

1.D or U, for a directed or undirected graph
2. N for a named graph (where nodes have a name attribute)
2. W for a weighted graph (where edges have a weight attribute)
3. B for a bipartite (two-mode) graph (where nodes have a type attribute)

The two numbers that follow (7 5) refer to the number of nodes and edges in the graph. The description also lists node & edge attributes, for example:

(g/c) - graph-level character attribute
(v/c) - vertex-level character attribute
(e/n) - edge-level numeric attribute

# examples

```{r}
nodes <- read.csv("Dataset1-Media-Example-NODES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)

links <- read.csv("Dataset1-Media-Example-EDGES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)
```

examine data

```{r}
head(nodes)

head(links)

nrow(nodes); length(unique(nodes$id))

nrow(links); nrow(unique(links[,c("from", "to")]))
```


Notice that there are more links than unique from-to combinations. That means we have cases in the data where there are multiple links between the same two nodes. We will collapse all links of the same type between the same two nodes by summing their weights, using aggregate() by “from”, “to”, & “type”. We don’t use simplify() here so as not to collapse different link types.



```{r}
links <- aggregate(links[,3], links[,-3], sum)

links <- links[order(links$from, links$to),]

colnames(links)[4] <- "weight"

rownames(links) <- NULL
```



other dataset

```{r}
nodes2 <- read.csv("Dataset2-Media-User-Example-NODES.csv", header=T, as.is=T)

links2 <- read.csv("Dataset2-Media-User-Example-EDGES.csv", header=T, row.names=1)

head(nodes2)

head(links2) #adjency matrix

links2 <- as.matrix(links2)

dim(links2)

dim(nodes2)
```


4. Turning networks into igraph objects

We start by converting the raw data to an igraph network object. Here we use igraph’s graph.data.frame function, which takes two data frames: d and vertices.

d describes the edges of the network. Its first two columns are the IDs of the source and the target node for each edge. The following columns are edge attributes (weight, type, label, or anything else).
vertices starts with a column of node IDs. Any following columns are interpreted as node attributes.

```{r}
library(igraph)
net <- graph_from_data_frame(d=links, vertices=nodes, directed=T) 

class(net)
```


```{r}
net
```

easy acces to nodes, edges, and attirbute

```{r}
E(net)       # The edges of the "net" object

V(net)       # The vertices of the "net" object

E(net)$type  # Edge attribute "type"

V(net)$media # Vertex attribute "media"
```


lets plot

```{r}
plot(net, edge.arrow.size=.4,vertex.label=NA)
```

remove loops?

```{r}
net <- simplify(net, remove.multiple = F, remove.loops = T) 
```
#this doesn't seem to be working?

If you need them, you can extract an edge list or a matrix from igraph networks.

```{r}
as_edgelist(net, names=T)

as_adjacency_matrix(net, attr="weight")
```

or as dataframes descibr nodes and edges
```{r}
as_data_frame(net, what="edges")

as_data_frame(net, what="vertices")
```


dataset2

As we have seen above, this time the edges of the network are in a matrix format. We can read those into a graph object using graph_from_incidence_matrix(). In igraph, bipartite networks have a node attribute called type that is FALSE (or 0) for vertices in one mode and TRUE (or 1) for those in the other mode.


```{r}
head(nodes2)

net2 <- graph_from_incidence_matrix(links2)

table(V(net2)$type)
```
